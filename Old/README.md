This chrome extension is a page action that works only on the webpage timetable.iit.artsci.utoronto.ca .

When run, it takes all the instructorâ€™s names and turns those names into links to the instructors ratemyprofessor page (if it exists). From there it strips all the information from that page and inserts it into the html on the artsci timetable.
