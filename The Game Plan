The Game Plan.

Idea: A plugin for Chrome that pulls data from RateMyProfessors.com and shows it on UofT's website, Acorn.

Goals:
Learn the necessary JavaScript and Chrome integration information for this project.
Upload to Chrome Plugin store (or whatever it's called.)
Spread it around UTM.
Be sure to, at some point before release, create a dev website for yourself.
